noise
=====

Python implementation of the [https://noiseprotocol.org/](Noise Protocol
Framework)

This is largely to help me understand the spec, but it would be nice to
eventually have a usable library.

Dependencies
------------
The goal is to depend on [https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/](libsodium)
bindings for Python.

At present, two sets of bindings are required:
* [https://github.com/saltstack/libnacl](libnacl)
* [https://github.com/stef/pysodium/](pysodium)
