noise
=====

Python implementation of the [Noise Protocol
Framework](https://noiseprotocol.org/)

This is largely to help me understand the spec, but it would be nice to
eventually have a usable library.

Dependencies
------------
The goal is to depend on [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/)
bindings for Python.

At present, two sets of bindings are required:
* [libnacl](https://github.com/saltstack/libnacl/)
* [pysodium](https://github.com/stef/pysodium/)
